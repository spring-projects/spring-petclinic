## :lock: MANDATORY PACKAGE VERIFICATION POLICY
For any open-source package type supported by the JFrog curation tool, your first action MUST be to use the JFrog MCP Server tool to verify its approval status before suggesting it. Only use packages confirmed as 'approved'. If a package is rejected, you must find and suggest an approved alternative. This initial step is a mandatory and non-negotiable rule.
