## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams

See the presentation here:  
[Spring Petclinic Sample Application (legacy slides)](https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application?slide=20)

> **Note:** These slides refer to a legacy, pre–Spring Boot version of Petclinic and may not reflect the current Spring Boot–based implementation.  
> For up-to-date information, please refer to this repository and its documentation.


## Run Petclinic locally

Spring Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) or [Gradle](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/).
Java 17 or later is required for the build, and the application can run with Java 17 or newer.

You first need to clone the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
```
If you are using Maven, you can start the application on the command-line as follows:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
With Gradle, the command is as follows:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can then access the Petclinic at <http://localhost:8080/>.

You can, of course, run Petclinic in your favorite IDE.
See below for more details.

## Building a Container

This fork ships an explicit `Dockerfile` - see [Container](#container) below. Upstream instead builds
the image with the Spring Boot build plugin:

## Running the Container Image

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
docker images | grep petclinic
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/spring-petclinic:latest
```

That is a local buildpack image, unrelated to the releases below.

## Container

### Build

```bash
docker build -t spring-petclinic:local .

# CI builds for the deploy target (GCE VMs are linux/amd64)
docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --build-arg BUILD_REVISION="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_VERSION="<semver tag>" \
  -t spring-petclinic:amd64 .
```

An image built on an arm64 Mac without `--platform linux/amd64` will not run on the VMs.

### Run locally

`docker-compose.yml` is a local development harness, not a deployment descriptor. Its credentials are
throwaway values for a container on your own machine and are never reused in the cloud.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose down -v
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

Note that `"db":{"status":"UP"}` alone does not prove MySQL - H2 reports the same. To confirm:
`docker compose logs app | grep "Database dialect"`.

### Environment variables

The image is configured entirely through environment variables, so the same artefact runs everywhere.
Two spellings reach the same properties: this repo uses the app's `MYSQL_*` placeholders, the Ansible
deploy role uses Spring's `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*`, which take precedence.

| Spring property | Local | Cloud | Cloud value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | `mysql` |
| `spring.datasource.url` | `MYSQL_URL` | `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` | Cloud SQL private IP |
| `spring.datasource.username` | `MYSQL_USER` | `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` | Cloud SQL app user |
| `spring.datasource.password` | `MYSQL_PASS` | `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | GCP Secret Manager, at deploy time |

The container listens on 8080.

### Actuator

Only `/actuator/health` (load balancer health check) and `/actuator/prometheus` (monitoring) are
exposed. Everything else returns 404.

### Releases

Every commit on `main` is a release. `.github/workflows/release.yml` bumps the minor version, builds,
scans, pushes, then tags: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, and so on. PATCH stays `0`; a major bump is a manual
tag, and the next run continues from it.

One image, two tags, one digest:

```
europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/petclinic-capstone/petclinic/petclinic-app:v1.1.0
europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/petclinic-capstone/petclinic/petclinic-app:sha-a1b2c3d
```

Deploys name a version. There is no `latest`.

The image is pushed before the git tag, so every tag has an image behind it. If a run dies between
those two steps, re-run it (the version is recomputed) or drop the orphan:

```bash
gcloud artifacts docker images delete \
  europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/petclinic-capstone/petclinic/petclinic-app:v1.1.0 --delete-tags
```

Releases are serialized, and a run waiting behind another can be dropped, so a commit may ship under
the next version rather than its own.

What a version contains, and what is in the registry:

```bash
git show v1.1.0

gcloud artifacts docker images list \
  europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev/petclinic-capstone/petclinic/petclinic-app \
  --include-tags
```

Our issue tracker is available [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues).

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`,
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:<uuid>` URL. The UUID is printed at startup to the console.

A similar setup is provided for MySQL if a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type changes, the app needs to run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySQL. See the [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/properties-and-configuration.html#howto.properties-and-configuration.set-active-spring-profiles) for more detail on how to set the active profile.

You can start MySQL locally with whatever installer works for your OS or use docker:

```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0
```

Further documentation is provided for [MySQL](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/mysql/petclinic_db_setup_mysql.txt).

Instead of vanilla `docker` you can also use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the database container:

```bash
docker compose up mysql
```

## Test Applications

At development time we recommend you use the test applications set up as `main()` methods in `PetClinicIntegrationTests` (using the default H2 database and also adding Spring Boot Devtools) and `MySqlTestApplication`. These are set up so that you can run the apps in your IDE to get fast feedback and also run the same classes as integration tests against the respective database. The MySql integration tests use Testcontainers to start the database in a Docker container.

## Compiling the CSS

There is a `petclinic.css` in `src/main/resources/static/resources/css`. It was generated from the `petclinic.scss` source, combined with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library. If you make changes to the `scss`, or upgrade Bootstrap, you will need to re-compile the CSS resources using the Maven profile "css", i.e. `./mvnw package -P css`. There is no build profile for Gradle to compile the CSS.

## Working with Petclinic in your IDE

### Prerequisites

The following items should be installed in your system:

- Java 17 or newer (full JDK, not a JRE)
- [Git command line tool](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
- Your preferred IDE
  - Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is a m2 icon in `Help -> About` dialog. If m2e is
  not there, follow the installation process [here](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/)
  - [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)
  - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Steps

1. On the command line run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
    ```

1. Inside Eclipse or STS:

    Open the project via `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project`, then select the root directory of the cloned repo.

    Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or use the Eclipse launcher (right-click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the CSS. Run the application's main method by right-clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`.

1. Inside IntelliJ IDEA:

    In the main menu, choose `File -> Open` and select the Petclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button.

    - CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or right-click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`.

    - A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate version. Otherwise, run the application by right-clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing `Run 'PetClinicApplication'`.

1. Navigate to the Petclinic

    Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks

The Spring Petclinic "main" branch in the [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are
[quite a few forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) in the GitHub org
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic). If you are interested in using a different technology stack to implement the Pet Clinic, please join the community there.

## Interaction with other open-source projects

One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days.
Here is a list of them:
